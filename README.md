## Create a test CRUD GraphQL API using Lambda & RDS(PostgreSQL)

Task Description: Implement AWS Lambda Functions and RDS Table for "User" Entity CRUD Operations

Description: This task involves creating AWS Lambda functions to handle CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for the "User" entity. Additionally, you need to check with me to set up an AWS RDS instance using PostgreSQL to store user data. The Lambda functions will act as resolver functions for a GraphQL API.

Task Breakdown:

Create AWS Lambda Functions for CRUD Operations:

Create AWS Lambda functions to handle the CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for the "User" entity.

Each Lambda function should be designed to handle a specific CRUD operation efficiently.

Implement error handling and appropriate response messages for different scenarios.

Set Up AWS RDS (PostgreSQL) for User Data:

Create an AWS RDS instance using PostgreSQL to serve as the database for storing user data.

Design the database schema to accommodate user-related information.

Ensure data integrity, normalization, and appropriate indexing for efficient querying.

Implement Resolver Functions for GraphQL API:

Integrate the Lambda functions as resolver functions for the GraphQL API.

Define the necessary queries and mutations in the GraphQL schema for user-related operations.

Implement the logic to invoke the appropriate Lambda function based on the GraphQL operation.


Note: Please keep the Jira ticket updated with your progress, any issues faced so that I can help you. Reach out for any clarifications or assistance needed during the implementation of this task.
